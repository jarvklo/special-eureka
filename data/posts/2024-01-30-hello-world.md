Markdown is just a simpler syntax for the most commonly used HTML
elements when writing body text.

A blank line marks a new paragraph (HTML `<p>`),
and a line starting with `##` is a HTML `<h2>`:

## Lists

An example of an unordered list:

- item one
- item two

And an ordered list:

1. item one
2. item two
